### Why are NULL, FIN and Xmas scans generally used?

> That said, the goal here is, of course, firewall evasion. Many firewalls are configured to drop incoming TCP packets to blocked ports which have the SYN flag set (thus blocking new connection initiation requests). By sending requests which do not contain the SYN flag, we effectively bypass this kind of firewall.

### Which common OS may respond to a NULL, FIN or Xmas scan with a RST for every port?
