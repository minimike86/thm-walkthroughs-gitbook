# THM Walkthroughs

{% hint style="info" %}
**TryHackMe** is an online platform that teaches cyber security through short, gamified real-world labs. We have content for both complete beginners and seasoned hackers, incorporation guides and challenges to cater for different learning styles.
{% endhint %}

This gitbook serves as a repository for the room guides and flag solutions. Unlike most walktrough write ups the flags will be hidden until you explicitly reveal them so you can read the guidance without spoiling the solution if you want to still gather the flag yourself afterwards!
