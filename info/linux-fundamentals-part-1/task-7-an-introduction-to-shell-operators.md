## Task 7 An Introduction to Shell Operators

### If we wanted to run a command in the background, what operator would we want to use?

<details>

<summary>Reveal Flag <span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f6a9">ðŸš©</span></summary>

:triangular\_flag\_on\_post:`&`

</details>

### If I wanted to replace the contents of a file named "passwords" with the word "password123", what would my command be?

{% hint style="warning" %}
**HINT**: echo \<content> > \<filename>
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Reveal Flag <span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f6a9">ðŸš©</span></summary>

:triangular\_flag\_on\_post:`echo password123 > passwords`

</details>

### Now if I wanted to add "tryhackme" to this file named "passwords" but also keep "passwords123", what would my command be

{% hint style="warning" %}
**HINT**: echo \<content> >> \<filename>
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Reveal Flag <span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f6a9">ðŸš©</span></summary>

:triangular\_flag\_on\_post:`echo tryhackme >> passwords`

</details>

### Now use the deployed Linux machine to put these into practice

{% hint style="success" %}
No answer needed
{% endhint %}
