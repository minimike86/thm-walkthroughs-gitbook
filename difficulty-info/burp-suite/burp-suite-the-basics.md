### There are many more configuration options available. Take the time to read through them. In the next section, we will cover the Burp Proxy -- a much more hands-on aspect of the room.

## Task 8 <mark style="color:orange;background-color:orange;">Proxy</mark> Introduction to the Burp Proxy

### Which button would we choose to send an intercepted request to the target in Burp Proxy?

<details>

<summary>Reveal Flag <span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f6a9">ðŸš©</span></summary>

:triangular\_flag\_on\_post:`Forward`

</details>

### **\[Research]** What is the default keybind for this?

_**Note:** Assume you are using Windows or Linux (i.e. swap Cmd for Ctrl)._

{% hint style="warning" %}
**HINT:** Use what you learnt in a previous task to look up the keybindings used in Burp Suite, then find a keybinding related to forwarding intercepted proxy messages.

## Task 9 <mark style="color:orange;background-color:orange;">Proxy</mark> Connecting through the Proxy (FoxyProxy)

### Read through the options in the right-click menu. There is one particularly useful option that allows you to intercept and modify the _response_ to your request. What is this option?

_**Note:** The option is in a dropdown sub-menu._

**\[Bonus Question -- Optional]** Try installing FoxyProxy standard and have a look at the pattern matching features.

## Task 10 <mark style="color:orange;background-color:orange;">Proxy</mark> Proxying HTTPS

### If you are not using the AttackBox, configure Firefox (or your browser of choice) to accept the Portswigger CA certificate for TLS communication through the Burp Proxy.

{% hint style="success" %}
No answer needed
{% endhint %}



## Task 11 <mark style="color:orange;background-color:orange;">Proxy</mark> The Burp Suite Browser

### Using the in-built browser, make a request to `http://MACHINE_IP/` and capture it in the proxy.

{% hint style="success" %}
No answer needed
{% endhint %}



## Task 12 <mark style="color:orange;background-color:orange;">Proxy</mark> Scoping and Targeting

### Add `http://MACHINE_IP/` to your scope and change the Proxy settings to only intercept traffic to in-scope targets. See the difference between the amount of traffic getting caught by the proxy before and after limiting the scope.

{% hint style="success" %}
No answer needed
{% endhint %}



## Task 13 <mark style="color:orange;background-color:orange;">Proxy</mark> Site Map and Issue Definitions

### Take a look around the site on `http://MACHINE_IP/` -- we will be using this a lot throughout the module. Visit every page linked to from the homepage, then check your sitemap -- one endpoint should stand out as being very unusual! Visit this in your browser (or use the "Response" section of the site map entry for that endpoint). What is the flag you receive?

{% hint style="warning" %}
**HINT:** You are looking for a suspicious page with a name made up of a series of random letters and numbers.

## Task 14 <mark style="color:orange;background-color:yellow;">Practical</mark> Example Attack

### Try typing: `<script>alert("Succ3ssful XSS")</script>`, into the "Contact Email" field. You should find that there is a client-side filter in place which prevents you from adding any special characters that aren't allowed in email addresses:

{% hint style="success" %}
No answer needed
{% endhint %}

### Fortunately for us, client-side filters are absurdly easy to bypass. There are a variety of ways we could disable the script or just prevent it from loading in the first place. Let's focus on simply bypassing the filter for now. First, make sure that your Burp Proxy is active and that the intercept is on.

{% hint style="success" %}
No answer needed
{% endhint %}

### Now, enter some legitimate data into the support form. For example: "pentester@example.thm" as an email address, and "Test Attack" as a query. Submit the form -- the request should be intercepted by the proxy.

{% hint style="success" %}
No answer needed
{% endhint %}

### With the request captured in the proxy, we can now change the email field to be our very simple payload from above: `<script>alert("Succ3ssful XSS")</script>`. After pasting in the payload, we need to select it, then URL encode it with the `Ctrl + U` shortcut to make it safe to send.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
No answer needed
{% endhint %}

### Finally, press the "Forward" button to send the request. You should find that you get an alert box from the site indicating a successful XSS attack!

{% hint style="success" %}
No answer needed
{% endhint %}

### Congratulations, you bypassed the filter! Don't expect it to be quite so easy in real life, but this should hopefully give you an idea of the kind of situation in which Burp Proxy can be useful.
