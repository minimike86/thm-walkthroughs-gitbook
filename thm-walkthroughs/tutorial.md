## Task 1 - Starting your first machine

### Follow the steps in this task. What is the flag text shown on the website of the machine you started on this task? _A flag is just a piece of text that's used to verify you've performed a certain action. In security challenges, users are asked to find flags to prove that they've successfully hacked a machine_

{% hint style="warning" %}
**HINT:** Remember to paste the IP Address of the machine you started on the task into FireFox on the AttackBox.
